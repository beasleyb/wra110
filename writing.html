			<h2>Lived Experiences</h2>
			<p>Every individual draws inspiration from, gives attribution to, some source that has set them on their current path. In my life that credit is given to my first desktop computer. It is, after all, responsible for my ongoing infatuation with technology. It was a circa 1999 Compaq computer, state of the art at 20GB storage, 512MB RAM, and a blazing 900 MHz processor accompanied by a monitor that weighed twice as much as the very furniture it sat upon. My mind, that of a child, would become lost in the possibilities that lay latent within these constructs. By virtue of that potential do we now enjoy our present-day infrastructure. What futures may unfold, I wondered, in an era with information readily available and perceptively immediate to avail? Archives of knowledge were so easy to access, perhaps even a youth from a poor, uneducated family might endeavor to become a physician, scientist, or engineer. Great were my expectations and rightly so. In the passing years my fervor for information, cemented by technology, has seen me graduate high school, fight through military service, and advance within university -- the first of my family to do so. Through it all I've grappled with deciding what realm of academia I might best leverage computer technologies. The pace of development is such that, some argue graphed, it strikingly resembles an exponential function. I've questioned: might biotechnology, nanotechnology, or an engineering discipline see the tremendous growth past the zero-point of such a trajectory? Maybe so. However, one subject alone persisted at the back of my mind -- the only subject which inspires an awe of limitless potential, not unlike the very technology that may one day afford mankind a vehicle into its vastness: the cosmos.
			<br><br>
			It was a short time after being discharged from the U.S. Air Force that I began reevaluating my course through life. A medical condition affecting visual acuity left me without a career -- the career -- I'd spent years building. It must be understood that a combination of youthful optimism, hardline conviction, and no lack of naivety had me convinced of my continued status in the military. It didn't help ground me that I was "pitching a perfect game". As metaphors go, it's an apt descriptor for the years prior to my dismissal. I soared to the top of my class in both academics and physical ability. Along the way, I was awarded a shadowing position within the Office of Special Investigations as well as a coveted Health Professional's Scholarship. To label either as "competitive" would be an exercise in understatement. In summary, I had gone from being an unimpressive, impoverished child to a rising all-star with the allowance to choose their future with ease. At least, that's how circumstance appeared.
			<br><br>
			If luck is indeed a lady, I must have scorned her. In haste I found myself without every facet -- painfully cultivated -- that comprised my identity. It'd be preferable to say that my recovery from such a deep and personal crisis was both quick and simple, but it would be a bold-faced lie. Initially, I succumbed to the ease of denying the reality of this new situation -- as if I'd be able to will away the negative aspects. As it turns out, "mind over matter" cannot trump the necessity of surgery. In time, however, denial was replaced with begrudged acceptance. Where to go from here? I contemplated it day in, and day out. Aside from a few scattered skills, I had nothing. My life lacked focus, let alone a pathway as my civilian self. Time continued as I, unwavering, observed its passing with apathy. Perhaps, even, there existed a tinge of contempt. Unfettered this practice went until, on an otherwise unremarkable day, I realized one constant yet remained and that I had spent years sitting in front of it, quite literally, lamenting the state of my misfortunes. That constant was my computer. Coincidentally enough, my ailment had spared a limited amount of vision, allowing me the ability to resolve objects from short distances. My remarkably late epiphany began reigniting the adolescent passion I'd experienced with my first desktop. If I could not come to the world, it would be made to come to me.
			<br><br>
			My limitations were no different than as a child. Upon appreciating the fact, I began scouring online for a multitude of subjects -- a practice that would have made any autodidact proud. In what seemed a short amount of time I had learned several piano pieces, became proficient in an array of programming languages, versed in history, chemistry, photography, and so much more. After what felt an incredible standstill, I was once again progressing. Still, despite my bolstered zeal, there remained an unmistakable void. Though the studies were intriguing, none restored the affections previously held for the military. Topics would fluctuate as if mere flavors of the week. Whereas at one point I might envision myself a prolific journalist, moments later I was certain in my prospects of becoming a bioengineer. Nothing resonated with me in a clear, lasting fashion. My new found vigor became tempered by frustration. Who is this person without identity, without accolade, without purpose? Who is that individual accumulating knowledge beyond reason and without designation? Who am I?
			<br><br>
			Positively, I knew only what I was not: a soldier. Nor did I hold any other station. The position of freely deciding which title to pursue was, in my belief, simultaneously damning and uplifting. Until recently, I've only ever operated in the context of being assigned a task and then perfecting it. Even the choice of joining the military presented itself in a set of four options -- four branches -- that hardly seemed a dilemma. Although, I might be wise to entertain the thought that, ultimately, I chose the Air Force simply because I like the color blue. Regardless, I now faced a far greater set of options. Thankfully, as I investigated through the gateway that was my computer, a coherency emerged. Truly, anyone with a degree of critical thinking would have come to appreciate the full truth of it sooner: all fields of study are interconnected. As though taking the shape of an evolutionary chart, they all related to one another in some way. An obvious conclusion, surely, but one of great import to an individual beset at having to choose one piece over the others. Earnestly, in such a person's view, all portions are equally stimulating while no single choice may seem complete. It couldn't be as simple as tracing back to a sort of originator, I thought. How about biology, then? Unfortunately, while the subject and its concentrations were no less appealing, it has no core relationship with, say, geology -- another subject I find just as worthwhile. On and on I sifted, looking for a grand unifier. Then, the Curiosity Rover touched down on Mars and I thought of nothing else.
			<br><br>
			It seems so obvious now. No genre captivated my imagination like science fiction. And what is a prevailing theme within the genre? Space Travel. I recall feeling complete envy for the characters in novels, movies, and video games. They held the liberty to traverse the stars at will. It was not the backdrop of galactic scenery I envied -- although, admittedly, I would trade anything for -- it was the opportunity to see, to study the workings of our universe. The idea of being that much closer, both literally and figuratively, to the constructs of our cosmos is exhilarating. I imagine an incalculable number of people have fantasized about the stars as I do. Only now, however, has technology aided recent generations in conceptualizing our surroundings to a great degree. At my discretion, I may search online for images of Jupiter, sensor data on Mars, or the spectroscopy of our Sun. I could become an engineer or scientist for agencies such as NASA, completing grand projects aimed at gathering information on our Solar System, Local Cluster, or even adjacent galaxies. If technology allows for what was once thought incomprehensible only decades ago, where can it take us into the future? The possibilities are unfathomable. As it is, planetary science and astrophysics are the main components of space research -- itself the grand unifier of all we strive to comprehend. Technologies such as those produced through computer engineering will be cemented as the tools our species will utilize for solving the mysteries that lie therein. Verily, it is the next logical step as a society, as a species, to embark upon an ocean of stars. And, while it is still early into my own new journey, I am eager to witness and take part in the furthering of space research.
			<br><br>
			Mankind has long peered into the heavens, inquisitive to the nature of its content. Indeed, well before written record, our ancestors likely gazed upon the stars exactly as we do today. I, as a constituent of this species, feel that this behavior is an integral part of our biology -- our identity. For millennia we were confined to the limits of our imaginations -- an extended period of history that saw the rise and fall of theologies, mythos, and aimless conjecture. Now, with the advent of, and advancements in many technologies, we've progressed from the narrow-minded, scathing criticism of Von Braun's rocket program to landing on the moon. What's more is the timeframe involved: less than a single century. Current technologies are developing at such an incredible rate that the realm of science fiction is now largely viewed in a context of “when” instead of “if”. For every new accomplishment, whole generations are being inspired to not only discover answers, but form entirely new questions on every possible subject. The arena of space exploration is not exempt from this cascade of limitless potential and with that in mind I continue into its depths, intent on having my own contributions considered indispensable to the records of history. It is imperative that we, as a society, endeavor to extend our reach into the cosmos as far as our limits will allow. We must do so, if only to better understand our place, our identity, within its boundaries. After all, and as it's been echoed in popular culture, space is "the final frontier".</p>

			<h2>Cultural Analysis</h2>

			<br><br>
			<h4>Executive Summary</h4>
			<p>In the late 1960s a nation of viewers began to glimpse into the thought-provoking world of Star Trek. At the time, the adventures of the U.S.S. Enterprise captivated people with stupendous technological and social concepts that appeared too fantastical to ever be realized. In time, however, technology has progressed beyond the historical canon of Star Trek and the social dilemmas that were overcome to reach the Federation's utopian society are of growing concern in present-day reality.
			<br><br>
			The television series details that the centuries prior to interstellar travel, humanity underwent an economic and social revolution caused by civil revolt. The driving factor that drove society to a breaking point was gross economic disparity creating severe stratification of people based on wealth. Eventually, the citizens of Earth reformed governing policy, moving towards the goal of a post-scarcity society. In order to avoid the grim scenarios proposed by Star Trek, it is imperative that the steps necessary to ensure a peaceful transition into a world of post-scarcity are taken. To do so, three points of reform are needed: a shift to renewable sources of energy, the implementation of Universal Basic Income, and the development of technologies that can lessen the scarcity of goods.
			<br><br>
			As of now, renewable energies such as solar and wind are viable options for replacing the entrenched dependence on finite fossil fuels. Universal Basic Income is possible through the aggregation of funds going toward existing social programs that would be unnecessary after the establishment of a UBI. Lastly, although the advent of matter conversion technology is well into the future, the existing technology of 3D printing can become the foundation that it is built on -- greatly reducing strain on resources in the process. The economic divide is widening and, as automation continues to replace jobs, the amount of impoverished peoples will grow. If civil unrest or social collapse is to be averted, emulating the economic principles of Star Trek might be the best answer.</p>

			<br><br>
			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			<p>As it is known, we are products of both our biology and our environment, and it is the environment that has dictated the outcome of our timeline far more than any other variable -- to include the cultures it so drastically alters. While some human landscapes of the world are defined by the abundance of particular resources, such as the Fertile Crescent once apart of Mesopotamia, others are known for what they lack. Indeed, it is the scarcity of resources that has affected the molding of cultures and, subsequently, the people belonging to them. Even with the advent of technologic wonders, our now global society relies heavily on trade and production to sustain itself. We classify regions of the world based on what they have and, if found lacking, are labeled as "less developed". This resultant state of affairs is neither shocking nor new. Commerce, war, subjugation and even love are, to differing degrees, affected by the long-standing limiting factor of society: scarcity.</p>
			<p>Our ancestors were readily cognizant of this obvious fact and it is no stretch of the imagination to presume its influence upon all creative developments, most notably literature. In literary works, and consequently theology, we've created ideal worlds that are free of pain or strife. Havens are described as lacking in any need -- veritable paradises where scarcity is non-existent. For millennia these environments existed solely beyond the realm of our perception. You'd only ever be permitted entry after your mortal life's flame was extinguished. That is no longer the case. While theology yet plays a role on mankind's stage, we are now capable of envisioning utopias within the limits of scientific knowledge. Arguably, the most acclaimed example of our time is a television show chronicling the intergalactic journeys of a starship crew under the banner of exploration: Star Trek.</p>

			<br><br>
			<h4>Background Analysis</h4>
			<p>Created by Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek is an American science fiction franchise encompassing five television series and a recent film series within its canon. The Original Series (as it's now referred) aired in 1966 on NBC. The show followed the adventures of the captain and crew of a space exploration vessel belonging to a 23rd-century governing body known as the "United Federation of Planets". The constituents of the 'Federation' include Earth and many fictional worlds sharing similar aspirations within the galaxy. At the time of its airing, The Original Series pushed controversial boundaries by including a multinational crew, an interracial kiss often wrongly-cited as the first on television, and a society that seemed, at the height of Truman Doctrine, founded on communist beliefs. Of course, with further analysis, such attributions are now considered hyperbole resultant of the tensions during the Cold War. In fact, the Federation operates as a vastly expanded form of European Socialist Capitalism; it has reached a point of incredible efficiency and productivity, such that labor and wage are no longer intertwined regarding the majority of economic activity. Essentially, citizens are not required to work unless they desire to. Subsequently, in the Star Trek Universe central banking has been dissolved. To be blunt, currency no longer exists -- a fact Roddenberry was adamant about (Cordone). If currency is irrelevant and benefits are extended beyond the needs of the citizenry, for what reason would people seek employment? It is explained that those who choose to work do so for personal and/or cultural fulfillment. The prevailing philosophy is the pursuit of advancing society as a whole. In the film "Star Trek: First Contact", Captain Picard explains the differences between 20th and 24th-century economics: "...The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives. We work to better ourselves and the rest of Humanity." Even now, some forty years after its inception, the world of Star Trek appears so different from our own. However, does it have to be? Regardless of the technological divide, we are likely capable of beginning the transition to a post-scarcity society, not unlike that of the Federation.</p>

			<br><br>
			<h4>Discription of the Issue</h4>
			<p>Civilization has approached a pivotal era for deciding the future zeitgeist. Should we maintain the status quo, our progeny will likely be born into an Orwellian vision at best, or dystopia at worst. These predictions have often been criticized as ridiculous exaggerations of the ongoing state of affairs. Though, as time moves on, criticism has gradually been replaced with trepidation. Unimpeded went the last two decades of the 20th-century and it appeared the principals of unabated capitalism reigned victorious over competing methodologies. It seemed the transgressions of the earlier half of the century all but vanished from memory. In the last decade, however, concern has reemerged in our collective mindset. For the better part of the decade many countries have found themselves entangled in the consequences precipitated by a war of attrition aimed at the United States. Economies continue to strain without a foreseeable end and, all the while, nations of people are assured by their representatives that support for the state and its provocations, both domestic and abroad, will see them safe and secure. Any dissent should be viewed as unpatriotic and against social norm. Meanwhile, the countries espousing liberty, freedom, and equality have seen dramatic increases in their respective prison populations and income disparity. The United States, ironically, leads in both incarceration rates and financial inequality. Despite having less than 5 percent of the world's population, the US claims approximately 25 percent of the prison populace (Liptak). Furthermore, in America the top 1% of earners retain an estimate 37% of the nations wealth (Smialek). Indeed, true democracy cannot coincide with unfettered capitalism. None of this is to say communism, socialism, or Marxism have faired better. In a world where scarcity is both naturally and artificially induced, the function of any system will be compromised no matter how benevolent its intended purpose may be. Society must therefore decide that the perpetuated monetization of goods and services become moribund. The capability to do so is within our grasp, made possible by advances in technology over recent decades, as well as those that are on the precipice of emerging.</p>

			<br><br>
			<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
			<p>In order to transition to a post-scarcity economy or, more accurately, a proto post-scarcity culture, three major objectives must be realized: the procurement of abundant, clean energy, provisions that meet or exceed the needs of citizens, and the capability to produce any good at will. For a modern civilization to thrive, let alone sustain itself, it requires ample reserves of energy. Today, that energy is largely supplied by the consumption of finite fossil fuels. Disregarding adverse effects on the environment, the concept of relying on limited sources of energy is completely untenable. The often-cited alternatives are renewable energies.</p>
			<p>By far, the best option resides in solar power. According to Dr. Richard Perez, editor of Solar Energy Journal at the University of Albany, potential insolation is estimated at approximately 23,000 Terawatts per year while the total energy demand of the world rests at 16 Terawatts each year -- estimated to reach 28 by 2050. Simply put, the Earth receives 1,500 times the energy needs of mankind every day. A conservative estimate at 2 percent convertible energy yields 460 Terawatts per year -- over 16 times the predicted demands of 2050. Placed into perspective, at 2 percent conversion for 4.5 years, the world's energy demands would be met for the next 50 years even if it increased by 1 Terawatt year over year.</p>
			<p>Next on the list is providing for fundamental human needs (food, shelter, etc). Unlike communism and socialism, Star Trek's Federation has no central planning and is therefore a free market of sorts. Consider it a crowd-sourced democracy where the citizens are guaranteed everything necessary for survival. Given the foothold of profiteering in our society, the only feasible first step is to work within its confines by allocating a universal basic income. A UBI would give people improved social mobility and the opportunity to safely advocate for better wages and working conditions. Some countries have already begun discussing the enactment of government issued UBI. Switzerland, for example, recently proposed a bill that would guarantee its citizens both a minimum wage and a UBI of 2,500 ($2,800) Swiss Francs per month (Coy). By providing a UBI we ensure for the survival of our people and solidify the sanctity of human life in the process.</p>
			<p>Finally, to truly enter a post-scarcity economy we ought to have the capacity to create goods in surplus. In Star Trek, this capability takes the form of replicators -- devices that are able to produce any good on demand by constructing them at the atomic level. In other words, replicators dismantle raw matter into energy, then rearrange atoms into the desired item of the user. Unfortunately, we are likely decades if not centuries away from developing such technology. However, we do have access to what may become the technological ancestor of replicators: 3D printers. A 3D printer takes material such as plastic or polymer binders and extrudes them into precise forms. It has advanced to a point that researchers at Cornell University recently printed a fully working speaker (Ju). 3D printing, in concert with certain nanotechnologies, may soon provide for a modest degree of functionality when compared to Star Trek's replicators. We only need support the development of such technologies.</p>

			<br><br>
			<h4>Anticipated Results/Effects</h4>
			<p>Initially, the implementation of procedures meant to transition us into a model of post-scarcity will be met with resistance from those with vested interest in the status quo. Already we see numerous examples of political pandering and espousal of the potential for job loss and economic Armageddon if countries adamantly begin moving toward renewable energies. Not surprising is the fact that these warnings originate, perhaps entirely, from fossil fuel conglomerates. Contrary to the dystopian proclamations of our friends in the oil industry, Germany has proven that an entire country can effectively rely on renewable energies for a large portion of their demands. As of 2014, 31% of the country's needs are met by renewable sources with the intention to eventually replace finite energy altogether (Winter). Granted, Germany is geographically much smaller than the U.S. or Canada, however, the principal has been proven and the precedence set: contemporary society has the technological capacity to rely on renewable sources of energy, thereby eliminating the scarcity of energy.</p>
			<p>The enactment of a Universal Basic Income would have profound effects on society. Regardless of the debate on how the marginal gap in funding for UBI could be closed, the argument in favor of its institution is that it is closer to feasibility than improbability right now. The consequences of doing so are varied, but the immediate conclusion would be an effective end to poverty as well as its symptoms, including homelessness and malnourishment. Beyond that, if it is even necessary to advocate beyond the abolishment of poverty, is the likely change in general landscape of employment. Employees, knowing that they are no longer reliant on their employers to survive, could more readily seek amenable opportunities and avoid feeling trapped at abusive organizations. Likewise, employers would be rid of the few inefficient individuals acting as broken cogs because they never had the aspiration to work in the first place. Effectively, a UBI would disconnect the need for basic survival from wage while yet retaining the incentive for a higher quality of life through employment.</p>
			<p>In supporting technologies like 3D printing, new ways of life can be made possible. Sustenance aside (for the time being), near-immediate access to goods would drastically alter the ease of doing business and improve overall quality of life. Inherently, technology is developed for two reasons: to better understand the world around us and to improve the efficiency of tasks we perform in our daily lives. Expediency is an integral part of what is considered efficient and 3D printers would greatly decrease the time necessary to acquire a tool, a utensil, a toy, and perhaps even a pair of shoes someday soon. Today, new applications are being developed in the construction of homes and within the medical community concerning the growth of new organs. With proper funding and support, 3D printing has the potential to scale to any task or area of research -- greatly enhancing our lives along the way.</p>

			<br><br>
			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			<p>It is jokingly said, with a tinge of sincerity, that Gene Roddenberry was from the future. His visions within the Star Trek Universe seem uncanny when reflected upon today. It is almost as if he had insight into the development of mobile devices, wearable technology, and -- incredibly -- warp drives which are now believed to be theoretically feasible. The more likely scenario, however, is that Star Trek inspired generations of people to emulate the fantastic concepts seen from the Federation of Planets. That is not to diminish Roddenberry; he was a visionary that understood the trajectory humanity would ultimately need to pursue to avoid the now-popular fantasies of dystopia. If we as a society wish to elude the grim possibilities wrought from grievous economic disparity and the consequences of relying on dwindling resources, then an approach not unlike that of Star Trek is necessary. Now that we have the means and technology to do so, it is time to transition toward the utopia we desire -- paving the way for a potential Federation of Planets by starting here, on Earth.</p>

			<h2>Formal Research</h2>
			<br>
			<p>In conducting this formal research report, it is my goal to introduce to you the broad field of Geographic Information Sciences in a way that is understandable to those new to, or unfamiliar with, the applications and technologies used within the discipline. In doing so, I hope to expound upon the ways in which we apply these technologies, and explain how we are able to use this data in our constant interaction with the world around us.</p>

			<p>The field of Geographic Information Science is vast, and multidisciplinary in nature. As recognized by the University Consortium for Geographic Information Science, the fields consist of the following: (1) cartography, including the analysis, design, visualization, and generation of assorted forms of maps, which take advantage of animation, user interaction, as well as analyti-cal processing; (2) cognitive science, which is concerned with how people think about their geo-graphic surroundings - for example, researchers use this information to make Geographic Infor-mation Systems easier to use, and even to improve the design of navigation systems in vehicles; (3) computer science, which houses specialization in areas such as spatial databases, computa-tional geometry, spatial reasoning, and digital libraries; (4) engineering and land surveying, which are the determination and physical protraction of land boundaries that serve as a basis of real estate and taxation; (5) environmental sciences, which advance research into the spatiotem-poral relationships of phenomena in both the natural and the human (including modified envi-ronment, the correlation/distribution of biotic and physical resources, ad well as the simulation of trends and conditions under varying assumptions of environmental processes) - this subfield in-cludes disciplines such as Forestry and Soil Sciences; (6) geodetic science, which researches the newest and most accurate methods for determining precise positions on the Earth's surface (for example, GPS units in cars and cell phones are able to establish their exact position anywhere on Earth by detecting satellite signals; (7) landscape architecture, in which Geographic Information Systems are able to aid in the design process of landscape architects, who address ecological is-sues as well as the physical, biological, and social characteristics of their sites; (8) law and public policy, which is important in addressing ownership rights in digital spatial data, liability associ-ated with the creation and use of geographic information, ethical use of geographic databases, access to geographic data and records of the government, and the effects of detailed spatial data sets on personal privacy ("Mission and Scope").</p>

			<p>While the list of subsets is long-winded, it is still incomplete. There are many other disciplines which are important to the field of GIS, however the 9 listed above are certainly worth mentioning in order to grasp the expansiveness of the field; they are also quite easily relatable to their everyday applications. Most specifically, interaction with these technologies is common-place in activities such as navigation (for instance, the devices in our cars or phones - Google undoubtedly has one of the most widely used programs with its Google maps application), in land use/land cover (this tells us what, exactly, our land is being used for, and what the land is considered, whether it be forested, urban, agriculture, and so on), and lastly remote sensing of our environment (which is the science of creating measurements of the earth using the sensors present on satellites or airplanes).</p>

			<p>While these utilitarian uses of GIS are extremely helpful to us in our everyday lives, the role of research is important in helping us to develop these tools. Interestingly enough, we ourselves can - and do - help to improve the very applications that make our lives so much easier, without even realizing it. During my interview with Professor Ligmann-Zielinska of Michigan State University's Department of Geography, she mentioned that Geographic Information Sci-ence combines the input of both scientific and public research in something called "volunteered geographic information", which is otherwise known as "crowdsourced geographic information". This is something you do whether you intend to or not; research can be gathered and accessed using information people post publicly online, such as restaurant "check-ins" and reviews, peo-ple blogging, vlogging, and tweeting about significant global events such as information regard-ing mass shootings, news regarding foreign relations, or natural disasters (such as forest fires, earthquakes and tsunamis (what comes to mind is the March 2011 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tōhoku, and the following Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor disaster)).</p>

			<p>Another important way of crowdsourcing is through our navigation; specifically through our phones while using applications such as google maps. For example, you can be notified of car accidents, construction sites, and heavy traffic by Google maps in close to real-time by the process of crowdsourcing; Google can gather data from any individual who has approved appli-cations using location data and estimate traffic conditions based upon the flow of traffic as indi-cated by those who have their cell phones in their vehicle. It has been so precise that Google Maps, in some instances, is able to predict traffic and potential congestion based on past condi-tions. This makes planning potential driving routes much easier, and far less stressful.</p>

			<br>
			<img src="./images/map.png">

			<p>As you can see in Figure 1 above, Google was able to show me any current congestion just north of MSU's campus - mostly on Grand River Avenue. The green indicates travel at normal speeds (50+ MPH), while the yellow indicates slowed traffic (25 - 50 MPH), and the red indicates traffic that is moving slowly (< 20 MPH). Applications such as Google maps and other types of web mapping are perceived by Dr. Ligmann-Zielinska (who was present for this transition of these very popular technologies) as being somewhat of a double-edged sword; on one hand it is extremely helpful, and generally it has become an addition to our lives that is useful, but these technologies did not grow out of necessity; instead they grew because they were a cool new technology. On the other hand, because these technologies have become so ubiquitous in our daily lives, they have indeed become essential to some of us. It used to be that if you went to an unfamiliar place you would read a map. She gave an example of going to Los Angeles for the first time and being overwhelmed with an alien location - quite obviously, if you needed to fig-ure out where to go, there are plenty of ways to do so. For instance, you could read a map (a tan-gible one), or ask people around you for directions. These technologies have become both a very useful tool, and also a detriment to our abilities to navigate the world around us.</p>

			<p>Aside from the practical uses of Geographic Information Systems by the layman, research is conducted and used in both professional settings as well as within academia. For instance, in my interview with Jay Samek, M.Sc., a Research Scientist in Social Forestry and Remote Sensing, he spoke about the research they are conducting at the Global Observatory for Ecosystem Services at Michigan State University. The laboratory utilizes geographic information systems, remote sensing, spatial analysis, and spatial tools to build systems in order to help map, understand, and measure changes in forest cover (specifically in the tropics), and exceeding that, to monitor the changes in forest carbon in many of the carbon pools in the environment (located within soils above-ground and below-ground). GIS research plays a central role in the analyses, building tools, and portrayal of data through web Geographic Information System platforms. </p>

			<p>In addition to the aforementioned functions using GIS in a research capacity, land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) is “…central to the interests of the science of global environmental change. It is a significant agent of change which influences, and is affected by, climate change, loss of biodiversity, and the sustainability of human-environment interactions, such as food and fibre production, water resources use, biological diversity, and human health. Land-use and land-cover change is thus a significant cause, or forcing function, of global change, and the medium on which much of the human responses to global change will take place. It is clearly an essential component in all considerations of sustainability” (Mastura & Skole 2).</p>

			<p>One other important use for Geographic Information Sciences, is the use of the technogy and research in urban planning. Considering how rapidly Earth's human population is increasing, urbanization is happening, but sometimes at great cost to our environment, or sometimes effects of the environment are detrimental to us. According to Deep and Saklani, “the mapping of urban sprawl using RS and GIS can be an instrument of decision support system for policy makers to design urban expansion plans with an approach of sustainable habitat development” (“Urban Sprawl Modeling Using Cellular Automata”).</p>

			<p>As you have read so far, there are many career paths one might take in the Geographic Information Science/Systems community, though I have barely scratched the surface of applica-tions in GIS. The discipline has some of the most diverse subfields within it, and they are all very important in their respective areas. This is, however, why it is difficult to give a precise salary. Salary will differ greatly based on location, education level, specialization, and experience.</p>

			<p>Considering figure 2 below, the jobs gathered from the 3,001 individuals who reported vary in pay. From Civil Engineers, who have the highest median salary at $59,483, to Environmental Scientists, who have the lowest paying job mentioned at $48,530 per year. It is also worth noting that depending on which subset one specializes in, they may be better suited working in different environments, in which some are much more lucrative than others - for example, a geologist working for the government in petroleum systems analysis makes between $50,279 - $203,193 per year, with a median salary of <a href="http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Petroleum_Geologist/Salary#CareerPaths">$99,659</a>. This displays the diversity in both pay scale and career paths in the field of Geographic Information Science.</p>

			<br>
			<img src="./images/graph.png">

			<p>Though the differences in pay are significant, GI Sciences are interconnected in some form or another; the community of research scientists, GIS individuals within academia, and those with careers in the private sector all use similar tools for communication in their work. The general technologies which make communication, research and publication possible include communication and collaboration, access to library and research materials and sources, and pub-lication and dissemination. Firstly there is communication and collaboration, which incorporates electronic mail, discussion lists, and computer bulletin boards. These tools make it easier for col-leagues to communicate and share their ideas locally, nationally and internationally. Distance-learning techniques also make it possible to hold interactive courses/workshops simultaneously at locations across the globe. Secondly is access to library and research materials and sources; expanding rapidly is network access to primary and secondary research resources, and now, scholars can obtain information held by research institutions, government agencies and libraries all over the world from their own offices. Lastly, publication and dissemination are being in-creased as the cost of publishing and distributing information decreases thanks to information technologies. They also reduce the time required to circulate news and research results (Foote and Lynch). For instance, just think about how quickly you can now find articles regarding your topics of interest just by typing a phrase into your favorite search engine.</p>

			<p>Mapping can also be considered a large part of the GIS community's interaction and communication between each other. There are so many different entities, but by using these tools within mapping, people in academia and people in the private sector have a way of communi-cating - albeit indirectly. Communication can also be seen in the form of scholarly articles and publications within the field, as research is constantly expanding. It is also important within the field to build scholarly communities for the advancement of GIS research, education and tech-nologies.</p>

			<p>In this regard, technology plays a central role - again, both in communication, and for the discipline in general. Modern technologies in the field of GIS use digital information, and there are several discipline-specific tools including; (1) cartography and computer assisted drafting, in which computers offer the same advantages to cartographers that word-processing software of-fers writers, and automated techniques are now considered the rule rather than the exception for cartographic production; (2) photogrammetry and remote sensing, which use aerial photogamme-try, which is a well-established technique for cartographic production as well as geographic analysis, which is now complemented by the use of "remotely sensed" information gathered by satellites in outer space. These information technologies have made either type of information much more readily available, not to mention improved the ease of use use; (3) spatial statistics, in which statistical analysis and modeling of spatial patterns/processes have relied heavily upon computer technologies. Advances in these technologies have made the aforementioned tech-niques more accessible, and have also allowed models to expand in complexity/scale to provide for more accurate depictions of real-world processes; (4) geographic information systems, which allow geographers to collate/analyze information more readily than is possible with traditional research techniques. GIS can be viewed as an integrating technology insofar as it draws upon and extends techniques in which geographers have used to analyze social and natural systems (Foote and Lynch). As you can gather, the field today relies heavily upon technology, and the technolo-gies have advanced significantly in just the last 20 years.</p>

			<p>Going back to my interview with Dr. Ligmann-Zielinska, she recalls how technologies in the Geographic Information Sciences were very different in the 1990's from her undergraduate and graduate work in Poland. While she was exposed to very basic GIS capabilities through the earlier versions of geographic information systems programs (particularly the programs IDRISI and ArcView), most all of the spatial and overlay analysis she did as an undergraduate was pro-duced by hand. She gave the example that if she wanted to calculate suitability, they drew maps on transparent paper, overlay them, and they could then figure out the most suitable location for a particular type of land use. It took hours just to preform the most basic overlay operations; per-haps for this reason, at this time GIS was not often used outside of academia (aside from within some large corporations) and GIS/web mapping didn't really extend out of academic research until around 2000 - 2005.</p>

			<p>Dr. Ligmann-Zielinska also recalls an intense debate in the late 90s regarding the categorization of the field due to the tools and technologies within GIS (concerning whether Geographic Information Systems/Sciences should be considered a discipline, or simply a collection of tools used for very specific analysis). She believes these dichotomies in opinion have greatly contributed to the ways in which the discipline of GIS is perceived today; she gives the example that there is a recognition within a group of, say, computer scientists who deal with spatially ex-plicit data and information or within a group of geographers in another sub discipline who under-stand that GIS it is more than just tools. Outside of this small pool of researchers, however, it is her experience that when collaborating with people both inside and outside of academia, they perceive GIS as being a tool, similar to how statistics is seen as a tool used for other various re-search purposes. Dr. Ligmann-Zilenska believes that GIS serves a purpose, but it is not a purpose in itself, because we want to serve particular problems, not just using it because it is “cool.” Re-gardless, from speaking with her I understand that the growth of technology in GIS has been very significant in the past two decades or so.</p>

			<h4>Composing</h4>
			<p>The topic of space exploration, while often mixed among the political rhetoric of congress, is one I believe better deferred to individuals educated in related disciplines. In broaching the topic of its importance, I appreciated that this project needed to be composed in a way that would convince the audience that, relatively speaking, space exploration should be a priority within our society. The audience, therein, is a target -- a communal body -- that needs to be educated on a topic unfamiliar to most. Beyond this role, the viewer is a potential force for advocacy; with a significant aggregate, the possibility increases for changing the political atmosphere in favor of space research. Earnestly, the most difficult task in attempting to create a documentary is composing a comprehensive, fluid narrative. Without a well-crafted narrative, a documentary will not only fail to support the issue it addresses, but could ultimately act as a negative force.</p>
			<br><br>
			<h4>Process</h4>
			<p>Space exploration is more than a passion for me -- it is an ideal. When deciding which paper to translate into visual media, the choice was simple given that my "lived experiences" paper was so deeply rooted in the marriage of technology and space. Although it is a topic close to my heart, constructing a viable documentary was not an easy task. I found it difficult to organize the thoughts and opinions of the people I interviewed into a unified message. Without a clear stance on the matter, the documentary would fail its intended purpose and come across more a debate. While bias is to be avoided, a concise position born from knowledge and logic is preferable compared to the other side of the debate on space exploration, which is mostly rooted in superstitious ad hominem.  The process of constructing an effective documentary is very much a systematic approach. Without following a step-by-step procedure, a documentary of this sort would readily be seen as unrefined and, therefore, unconvincing. Of the stages involved, interviewing, editing, and post-processing, the interviews are the most integral. Without adequate responses to intriguing questions, the end result will always lack a compelling argument. You can try to add all the special effects you'd like, but, as the adage goes, "you can't polish a turd" (the gentlemen at Mythbusters excluded).</p>
			<br><br>
			<h4>Project Management</h4>
			<p>The planning for this project was one of the most difficult tasks. It is necessary to anticipate setbacks on multiple levels, especially regarding interviewees. Inevitably, some of those individuals will, perhaps miraculously, seem to fall off the face of the planet and, while that would be impressive material for a documentary based on the urgent matter of spontaneous gravitational failure, it will likely only serve to hinder most other pursuits. With proper planning, I was able to interview two of the seven individuals I initially asked to participate. Although that might appear to be a disappointing fraction, my expectation was to successfully meet two or three authorities on the subject of space. If, however, I were to perform this project a second time, I would actually be more generous in the number of inquiries I'd make. Moreover, on an aesthetic note, I would also plan for more time with regards to lighting the person on camera. As it turns out, it's hard to focus on someone when the light hitting them makes it appear as if they're in a Van Gogh painting.</p>
			<br><br>
			<h4>Research</h4>
			<p>Surprisingly, NASA was of little use in this project because they don't seem to prioritize the distribution of content as much as the ESA (European Space Agency), for example. Aside from what exists in the public domain, it is actually rather difficult to find detailed information on several of the Apollo missions. Admittedly, this could be confirmation bias due to my coming across far more instances of people trying to argue that the moon landings were staged. Actually, this phenomena extended well beyond the Apollo missions, meddling several important topics of my research. Some individuals went so far as to argue that space itself did not exist. Yes, there are people who literally believe space itself is a hoax. If I were to arrange my sources of information from most to least helpful, it would be as such: interviewees, the ESA, media repositories (YouTube, Vimeo) and, lastly, NASA and the general areas of the internet (due in part to poor citation or conspiracy babble).</p>
			<br><br>
			<h4>Design</h4>
			<p>Again, I must refer back to the great importance of a narrative in a documentary. It is not an easy task to create an aggregate from several sources that effectively informs the viewer of a topic's impact, as well as the degree to which that importance lies. After the interviews, the research, and the post-processing comes the most arduous yet rewarding aspect. Through the effort place in crafting this documentary, the narrative is compelling and, aesthetics aside, the most effective part. My design decisions were based on the desire to communicate not only the importance of space exploration, but also the fact that we are and have been capable of astounding feats for decades. After the end of the Apollo mission, however, support for space organization diminished and the collective dream of society slowly faded away. It is my hope that through my documentary and others like it, that the passion I hold for space and technology is reignited in future generations. Those alive in 1969 experienced the incredible awe of men landing on the moon. It's time that we prioritize the topic that inspired entire generations before us.</p>

			<h2>Course Retrospective</h2>
			<br>
			<p>It is fascinating when considering the fact that throughout most of recorded human history, the ability to read and write was not only an incredible skill, but also a privilege afforded only to those amongst or in service to the upper echelons of society. In contrast, literacy is now ubiquitous within developed countries and still prevalent in others. So accessible is education that most adolescents become disenchanted with school subjects altogether. Of the subjects that are often least enjoyed is writing. Again, one could look only a century into our past and be astonished by the dichotomy between then and now regarding the subject. It has been posited that this dramatic change is due in part to the advent of technologies that compete for our attention. Mobile phones, tablets, smart watches, and now Google Glass create an environment of immediate gratification. Why read when someone on a screen can simply tell you what you'd like to hear? Interestingly, the technologies that shifted our collective attitude away from reading and writing could also be the means by which to reinvigorate the subjects. WRA 110 aims to address that very matter.
			<br><br>
			I preface this retrospective paper with the aforementioned because, admittedly, I am guilty of allowing my attention to be averted away from reading and writing toward 'more entertaining' endeavors. As a child, I recall having fervor for reading; I'd read several novels a week and dreamed about "putting pen to paper", as the adage goes. Somewhere along the way that passion extinguished and was replaced with video games and movies. That is not to say these forms of media are without merit or are inferior to the written word. On the contrary, it was my love for reading that led me to video games because, at the time, they were essentially graphic novels that visually immersed you into another universe. I digress, as the point is that as a teenager I loathed being assigned a topic to write about. Now, with regards to general education writing at university, I am speaking from the perspective of an upperclassman instead of as a freshman. I put off taking this class for as long as possible. You'll likely see a trend between my adolescents and myself as a young adult. However, and to my surprise, WRA 110 (Writing, Science & Technology) was not the terrible experience I anticipated. I credit this to both the scope of the course and its instructor, Dr. Daniels. To come full circle, the course is designed to inform the student how technology can share an intimate relationship with writing, thereby becoming a subject aimed at methods for modern communication. Further, is has been Dr. Daniel's pursuit to have her class learn the skills necessary to engage in these methods to become effective communicators in today's society. This includes having a base appreciation for your intended audience, composing a proper narrative, and conveying your message as clearly as possible. Each assignment is designed to aid incoming freshmen -- and the odd upperclassman -- with developing these areas so that they are adequately equipped for becoming productive members in their respective fields.
			<br><br>
			For incoming students, my advice in lieu of a synopsis regarding each assignment is the following: learn time management, ask as many questions as needed, and evaluate who your audience is, why you're speaking to them, and how to concisely deliver your topic. This will involve research in a quantity that will initially seem overwhelming but, as you adjust, you will come to appreciate its necessity in becoming a talented communicator. Understand that each assignment is a dialogue between you and your readers. This is an underlying truth irrelevant of what type of paper you're writing, or even if you're creating a video (hint: you will be). The most difficult type of paper to apply this understanding to is a research paper and, given that this course is based on science and technology, you will be writing one. So long as you adhere to the core tenets mentioned prior, research papers will become second nature; for those that learn to properly compose and format research papers, you will have a great advantage amongst your peers. Do your best to follow the outlines provided to you but do not be apprehensive in "breaking the mold". Any worthwhile instructor will appreciate a student that delivers a unique product from a fresh perspective. As with all things in life, it is a matter of quality over quantity. Lastly, to individuals like myself who find their writing perhaps too verbose or complex, understand that writing more prosaically does not mean you are -- or will come across as -- less intelligent; conversely, it allows you to reach a wider audience, thereby connecting with more people. That is the essence of writing and research: connecting and sharing your ideas with those around you. Of my entire academic career thus far, this has been the most valuable lesson I've learned. The sooner you understand, the easier your experience at a university -- as well as beyond -- will be.
			<br><br>
			Although I tried my best to avoid this course, I do not regret my time spent in it. The projects were enjoyable to perform and they, along with Dr. Daniels, reinvigorated a part of the passion I once held for writing. Simply reflect on the fact that, only a century ago, your great-grandparents deemed themselves fortunate to have the ability to read and write while today we take it for granted without a second thought. Come to this realization and, If you approach this course with an open mind and a priority toward learning the topics I've addressed, you will find your experience as rewarding as my own.</p>
