			A short list of my talents and exploits:

				<li>I once stopped an earthquake with my bare hands.</li>
				<li>Gravity actually recognizes me as the only law.</li>
				<li>Chuck Norris replaces himself with me when he tells a joke.</li>
				<li>String theory is based on one of my third grade papers.</li>
				<li>The "Mission Impossible" movies are true stories from my life.</li>
				<li>Artifical intelligence has yet to emerge due to its intimidation of me.</li>
